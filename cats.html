			<h3>Charlie</h3>
			
				<p> Charlie is my own personal cat who I have had since I was 10. He is also now 10 years old. I have grown up with him and he now lives with me in my apartment. He is mostly a cinnamon ragdoll cat mixed with something else that we are not sure of. He doesn't do well with out cats due to his anxiety and he just doesn't share well. Yes, he is pretty chubby weighing in at almost 20lbs, but he is a big teddy bear(almost literally). However, he is also the sweetest loving cat that loves to play and cuddle. As Charlie is my personal cat, he is also my favorite. We spend lots of time together and he watches me do homework or just hangs out while I eat. He gets a lot of seperation anxiety when I leave to go to class or work but will always have the biggest welcoming home party. </p>

				<p> JJ, which stands for "Jasper James", is one of the cats that lives at my parents house but I grew up with. He is a 8 year old domestic long-haired cat with beautiul coloring and very big paws. He is my dad's "co-worker" due to the fact that he only hangs out with my dad in his office while working. He is a very sweet gentleman who doesn't pick fights or gets rowdy in any way.</p>

			<h3>Benny</h3>
				<p> Benny, otherwise known as "Benten", is a 12 year old grey tabby cat. He is the smallest of all of my cats only weighing in at 8lbs. While he is the oldest cat in the house, he is the biggest baby. He will constantly follow us around the house waiting for someone to sit or lay down so he can cuddle with you. However, don't let his cuteness fool you, he is the biggest manipulator when it comes to food. He will trick you by looking cute and crying at you to give him food. </p>

				<p> Parker is the newest addition to our family. He is only 4 years old and is an all black domestic short hair with an all white tummy. Now parker was named after Peter Parker, also known as Spiderman, due to his personallity. He is very playful and will climb just about anything. He also is our only outdoor cat that will be let out once or twice a day. We do this so he doesn't sneek out without us knowing. We would rather control it than let him disapear. </p>
