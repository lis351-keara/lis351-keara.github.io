				<p1> This is my family. My parents and my brother are pretty much my whole life. They have been there for me my whole life and have never made me feel like I wasn't loved. I am always completely supported in everything I do and will even join me in my adventures. My family consist of my mom, Nicole, my dad, Matthew, and my brother, Colin. I would also consider my cats part of our family but I won't include them on this page.</p1>

				<h3> My mom </h3>
					<p> My mom is one of the best people I've ever known. She was a stay at home mom since I was born and hasn't stopped taking care of us since. She is my personal role model in life wheather she knows it or not and I want to be half the woman she is. My mom spent a lot of her time before meeting my dad working to help pay for college and get a degree in network engineering. Clearly I am biased but she really has done it all and doesn't give up on anything. Due to the obstacles in her life, she had to work much harder and I strive to be that determind. She says that she doesn't regret a thing and would make the exact same choices shes made which I find inspiring.</p>

				<h3> My dad </h3>
					<p> I am not scared to say I am a daddy's girl. My dad is my safe space and comfort. He is the person I will go to anytime I need someone or when I am having a hard time. He will pick the phone up on first ring. He reponds to texts immediately. He would pick me up no questions asked if I needed. My dad is my person and will be forever. He is our head of household and is the only one who works to provide for us. He works so hard at a job that he has been doing since before I was born and has been promoted many times. Every day of the week he works many hours a day so my mom, brother and I can do the things we want to do. His love is unconditional and everlasting. I will treasure him forever. </p>

				<h3> My brother, Colin</h3>
					<p> Now my brother is not someone I get along with most of the time. We have very different lives and personalities which make it hard to talk about things we have in common. I often find myself reaching out to check in on him and school because I don't hear from him much. However, I would do anything for hime because he is my little brother. I want him to succeed in life and want him to live it to the fullest. I hope to become closer as we get older and find more things in common because he is a very interesting person. </p>
