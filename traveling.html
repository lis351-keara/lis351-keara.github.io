		<h2><u>My top 5 travel spots</u></h2>
		
			
			<article>
			<h3>1. London</h3>
				<p> London was an amazing city to visit and it had so much to offer. This is my top pick for vacation because it made me feel the most free. The transportation was very easy to use and didn't make me feel unsafe at any point. The "tube" as they call it, was very fast in getting to any places you needed to go and it had so many stops to allow for travel all over the city. As for the food, my personal favorite place was <a href="https://www.nandos.com/">Nando's</a>. They are a South African fast casual restaurant chain that specialises in Portuguese flame-grilled, peri-peri style chicken. Overall, my experience in London was history packed, arcitecturally beautiful, and freeing. </p>

				<p>  Washington D.C. is number 2 on my list due to how much I would want to live there in the future. The cobblestone sidewalks, brick roads, fancy white trim, older lamp posts, walkable city, I could go on and on about the amazing features the city itself has. The people are always outside either walking, running, biking, or just sitting in a park. Overall the city is very welcoming and has amazing sights to see. I have gone to D.C. 4 times now, once by myself and all I can say if that it has so many experiences for all ages and the food doesn't disappoint. </p>

			<h3>3. Italy </h3>
			
				<p> Though I have only been to Venice, Italy, I am very sure of the cutlure and the expereince it offers. I am planning on studying abroad in Florence in the spring and I am very excited to go back. Italy will always have a special place in my heart not because of the physical place, but the cutlure, the values, the traditions, and food will always remind me of home. My dad's side of my family is from Italy and I have always treasured them and their background. So finally being able to go and get just a small piece of what their lives were like is freeing. I hope to explore that feeling more when I live there. </p>

				<p> Greece is one of those places you see everyone go to and want to just experiece. That was how I felt in high school when picking a destination for my graduation trip. I really wanted to go to greece and experience the amazing arcitecture and views. That is exactly what happened. It is everything everyone says and more. I personally went on a greek isle cruise and was fortunate enough to visit more than one place in Greece. I was in Athens, Santorini, Mykonos, Zakynthos, and Crete. Honestly, Santorini was slightly touristy but all of the other islands were amazing. My personal favorite was Zakynthos because it was breathtakingly gorgeous. The water was so clear and the island was full of life. I hope to one day go back. </p>

		<h3>5. Montenegro</h3>
		
				<p> Now Montenegro is one of those countries I don't think many people know about. It is a very small country in the balkans next to Croatia and Serbia. When going to Kotor, it was apart of my Greek Isles cruise and I didn't know anything about it. I honestly was not expecting much when getting there but then we to a boat cab from the ship to the Bay of Kotor and let me tell you, It was incredible. The mountainous greenery, the blue water, the arcitecture, the medieval towns and. Everything about first getting off the boat and walking the cobblestone streets fill with people, cats and greenery. It was very shocking that this place is not as well known especially because the hike of the Fortress of San Giovanni was incredible.  </p>
